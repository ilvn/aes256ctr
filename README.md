This is a portable byte-oriented implementation of AES-256 encryption in
CTR mode. It is based on the original byte-oriented AES-256 code
available at http://www.literatecode.com/aes256


We can formally verify this code by using CBMC - a bounded model checker
for C/C++ programs, available at http://www.cprover.org/cbmc/
